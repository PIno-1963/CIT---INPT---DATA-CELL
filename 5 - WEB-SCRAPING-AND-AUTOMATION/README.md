Through this workshop session they have covered many Web Scraping and Automation concepts from the very beginning and introduced techniques such as using the browser's DevTools and interacting with many libraries such as `requests`, `bs4`, `json` and `selenium`. 

The workshop practice notebook contains an activity with a recap of the major steps used to scrape an online page. The goal is to retrieve images for a Deep Learning model to learn to classify two different categories.

Our aim is to help learners put their knowledge into practice and to motivate learners about the next module which is **Machine Learning**.
